# CompGraphic-Visualization

    How do I approach designing software? <br/>
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?<br/>
        Working on this project helped me to learn the process for creating a 3D scene in OpenGL using the OpenGL shader language. I learned how to construct 3D shapes from
				a number of basic shapes and meshes, I learned how to add texture and color to the items, I learned how to code a camera that can maneuver through the 3D scene, and I also learned
				how to apply the Phong lighting model to the scene and objects.<br/>
        What design process did you follow for your project work?<br/>
				The design process I followed was to create the 3D scene using the basic meshes, apply color, apply camera controls, apply texture, and then apply lighting to the scene.<br/>
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?<br/>
				Tactics from this design approach help to lay out the process for creating 3D scenes in the future.<br/>
    How do I approach developing programs?<br/>
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?<br/>
				One of the main strategies that I used while creating the 3D scene was making the code modular so that it could be easily edited at any time.<br/>
        How did iteration factor into your development?<br/>
				With simple 3D scenes iteration didn't play a huge factor, but I could see using iteration quite a bit in more complex 3D scenes that have physics applied to them.<br/>
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?<br/>
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?<br/>
